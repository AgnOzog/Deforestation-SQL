# Project Deforestation Udacity

## Summary

The Deforestation project by Udacity is an analysis project that aims to use SQL queries to explore a dataset on global deforestation, with the goal of identifying the major causes of deforestation and proposing solutions. The project provides a dataset containing information on global forest cover, deforestation rates, and drivers of deforestation, such as agriculture, logging, and mining. The project requires the use of SQL to query the dataset and Jupyter Notebook to visualize the results. The project also provides guidance on the steps involved in performing the analysis, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization. The project culminates in a report that summarizes the findings and proposes solutions to mitigate deforestation.
